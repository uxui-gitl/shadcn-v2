The nature of the business was such that each product is designed as per unique customer requirements. This leads to the need for an integrated system of tracing orders from raw material sourcing to final shipment of finished products. Given the competitive business environment, the dependency on the quality and timely delivery of suppliers was creating a bottleneck in the overall supply chain performance. The many years of history of this organization had led to a bloated supplier base that needed reconciliation based on active performance. The organization was set up as a parent entity with multiple diverse business subsidiaries spread across geographies. This led to complex reporting requirements and the need for real time strategic financial information at different levels of hierarchy. Complicated inventory processes at the warehouse and shop floor were proving to be inefficient to handle the large volume of transactions. The IT infrastructure comprised of a large number of isolated legacy systems that led to data, time and effort duplication across departments.",
