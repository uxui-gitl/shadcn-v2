      "<p>My friend joked that whole humanity has been house arrested. That put me in thinking what I am experiencing in this “jailed environment” personally.</p>  <p>I feel my hearing has improved as I hear more of bristles of wind, chippering of so many varieties of birds, squirrels, butterflies, and bugs which I had lost in the continuous buzzing sounds of machines.</p>  <p>I feel my eyesight improved as I can see beautiful sky as blue now than the usual murky brownish.</p>  <p>I had forgotten that so many stars, constellations, and milky way still exist over my city. I thought they vanished from the universe when we became the Masters of It. My kids are amazed that we together can identify so many figures in these constellations which they only read in books or heard from teachers.</p>   <p>I now smell fragrances of blooming flowers which blow with the breeze instead of the foul smell of smog which I got used to with continuous cough</p>  <p>My food tastes much better as it’s cooked by my wife and daughters with secret love spices instead of me ordering exotic greasy and spicy ones from restaurants. And as a family we are bonding much better while working together as we have more time for each other.</p>  <p>I am not worried about the continuous burning of eyes and breathing issues as the smog is gone. My back doesn't hurt anymore from mad driving and long jams as I just spent 50 milliliters of diesel to buy essentials instead of the usual 140 liters per month.</p>  <p>I can video call my loved ones and friends who I hadn’t spoken for a long while and who were only connected to me via WhatsApp forwards.  Our country’s rivers are now full of fishes and other life forms which used to be loaded with filth while multiple governments spent lakhs of crores to clean them for decades and failed miserably. </p>  <p>My house receives so many uninvited but most beautiful visitors now throughout the day. They are not human but birds, bees, butterflies and I hear in some localities wildlife animals are also roaming free. Many of them were confined to zoos or some social media post on nature. </p>  <p>This all comes together in the post COVID life, where workload has increased 5 times, work time per day has increased to average 16 hours, office duration is 24*7. Assignments are mostly out of the blue, unthinkable, unfamiliar tasks which never got captured in the best of Business Continuity Plans and Disaster Recovery Plans, but now are business as usual.</p>  <p>All this might be a big relief to my HR who were trying for decades to break the enigma of what would be the best work life balance for employees, so they continue to be motivated and don’t get burn out. </p>  <p>Wondering what the heck I was doing that I missed out on so many “Normals” of life which I had enjoyed in my childhood. But gave only stories of them to my kids.</p>  <p>Or were we taking normal life too much for granted and it had become “Abnormal” gradually pre- lockdown, as we became too self-centered without realizing. </p>  <p>Was I turning into a robot and losing the basic feeling of “Being Human”?</p>",

      '<p>“We are passing through an unprecedented situation, which we may have never seen or heard in our lifetime.” Haven’t we been listening to this statement over and over again in the last couple of months and for that matter, I too have been repeating it at every opportunity. Of course, it’s true, that we had never imagined this situation in our wildest dreams. Like every other unprecedented situation, this also seemed as if it came unannounced, but it was very much present in our midst, we never envisaged the intensity and were caught unprepared. The key question now staring in our face is, “where do we go from here and what do we do next”?</p>  <p>This pandemic which has impacted the entire humanity in terms of health and economic turmoil, has economist struggling to evaluate the possible fallout of this situation. Large and strong economies are falling, oils price has nosedived to its lifetime low, inflation is expected to increase multiple fold. Business close down, employees losing their jobs and those who can sustain business, have a risk of pay cuts and deferrals. As a global country and unified economy, I am quite hopeful that things would start improving quickly and people will not starve to death.</p>  <p>While going through information available across the media it is very apparent that although all industries have been impacted, the major hit has been taken by the mid-sized companies. A single wrong step would lead to disaster for such companies, it would result in lower business volumes, cash flow, fixed costs pressure, and the need to meet statutory compliance. This made me ponder on the path ahead. Was there a reference of similar situation in the realms of history which can be assessed and analysed to find out the best possible options? How could it be relevant for the IT Industry, especially for the mid-sized companies.</p>  <p>If we analyse in context to our business and bringing in a turnaround and define the future for us as individuals and as an Organization, we need to derive the following action plan.</p>  <p style="text-align:right"><a href="../assets/pdf/blogs/kc-blog.pdf" target="_blank">Read More</a></p>',

      '<p>Most enterprises are in the process of migration from legacy systems to new, user-friendly dynamic and robust web applications. In this crowded market of different technologies such as PHP, HTML5, WordPress, Magento and several others, Microsoft’s ASP.NET has proved to be ‘the popular choice’. ASP.NET is one of the best web development frameworks that has the power to build websites or web applications that can scale your business to the next level of success. With this framework, developers can build all kinds of apps from the simplest ones to the most complex ones using multiple programming languages such as C++, VB, C#, JS using UDDI, WDSL, OOP, ASP, SOAP and XML.</p>    <p><strong>Types of Development</strong></p>    <p>There are 3 types of ASP.NET application development:    </p>    <p><ul>   <li> MVC</li>      <li class="listStyleInner">MVC architecture makes it simpler to build complex applications in less time. Developers have the flexibility to customize MVC patterns and behavior as per the requirement of the business applications.</li>   </ul>    </p>    <p><ul>   <li> Web Pages</li>      <li class="listStyleInner">This type of ASP.NET development is used for creating web pages using PHP and HTML. Rapid Application Development techniques can be used which require less to minimal coding efforts.</li>  </ul>    </p>    <p><ul>   <li> Web Forms</li>      <li class="listStyleInner">This type of ASP.NET development is useful for building dynamic, small and fast performing applications. It demands less coding than the MVC pattern and gives more control to programmers.</li>  </ul>     </p>    <h5><strong>Key Benefits of using ASP.NET Technologies</strong></h5>    <p>   <ul>    <li>Build applications that are completely secure due to the built-in Windows authentication and per-application configuration</li>    <li>Minimal coding required to build large applications</li>    <li>Developer-friendly features such as automatic deployment, WYSIWYG editing and drag-and-drop server controls</li>          <li>As all the configuration information is built-in, there is no process of registration of components. This allows for easy deployment of applications.</li>          <li>Applications executing on the server are monitored for all pages, components and applications. This helps in detecting memory leaks, infinite loops and other illegal activities.</li>   </ul>    <p>  <h5><strong>List of Essential Tools to know about ASP.NET</strong></h5>  <ul>          <li>Microsoft Web Platform Installer</li>          <li>Visual Studio Gallery</li>          <li>NuGet</li>          <li>ReSharper</li>          <li>ELMAH</li>          <li>NDepend</li>          <li>SQLComplete</li>          <li>Web Essentials for Visual Studio</li>          <li>Chocolatey</li>          <li>LINQPad</li>          <li>BenchmarkDotNet</li>          <li>JSON Formatter</li>          <li>PowerShell</li>          <li>NDepend</li>          </ul>        <p>      Godrej Infotech Ltd. is a Microsoft Certified Partner with a proven ability to handle complex .NET programming projects and in-depth knowledge of latest technologies in ASP.NET, user interface and methodologies.

      '<p>Over the last couple of months, COVID has become a global crisis, affecting the entire workforce, irrespective of the scale, industry and geography of the organization. </p>    <p>In the current situation of this pandemic, stay-at-home, work-from-home, travel restrictions and lockdowns have become the “New Normal”. This situation has given rise to a debate on how businesses will embrace change and how the way of working will span out in the post COIVD-19 scenario. Everyone anticipates that the world of Business and way of life for communities is not going to be the same in the short, medium and long term.</p>    <p>In terms of ‘Business Continuity’, people from the Information Technology industry in that regards have been able to successfully transition from the ‘work-from-office’ to the ‘work-from-home’ mode. Remote working, working from home or from anywhere for that matter is now a critical business capability and organizations across the globe need to have strategic plans to accommodate for this, not only in terms of business continuity planning but as a new normal operating scenario.</p>    <p>In this age of convivence, companies around the world are trying to leverage technologies to find innovative, unique ways to improve the operations management and execution of day-to-day activities. The common theme that is emerging about the “New Normal” from a business perspective across the globe is: “Being Virtual is the new Reality!”</p>  <p>Let’s analyze what it means by being virtual in the business application context and how technology trends are accelerating the development and adoption of new products and services across industry sectors.      <ul>          <li>Social distancing or virtual presence will be the new business norm. </li>          <li>Digital-led and contactless experience will play a major role going forward.</li>      </ul>  </p>  <p>Clearly new normal is virtual operations management wherein product and service need to be enabled for virtual delivery and virtual support to on-going operations to the maximum extent possible.</p>  <p>  Interestingly there are technology solutions available even today which are helping organizations cope up with current pandemic situation.

      '<p>In the current situation of cashflow challenges and low budgets to invest in IT CAPEX, companies can move to a better IT Infrastructure, which is OPEX based, scalable, secure, cost effective and above all accessible anytime from anywhere on any device.</p>  <p>Whether you want to entirely migrate to the cloud or want to have a hybrid cloud infrastructure, Microsoft Azure is the best cloud computing service you can decide to choose. Here are the top reasons for rapid Microsoft Azure migration:</p>  <ul>   <li>     <b>Cost effective Scalable IT Environment</b>    <p>Take advantage of Pay as per use IT Infra / License cost and facility to scale up or scale down as per your business requirements.</p>    <p>Azure Cloud provides significant benefit per compute in terms of <b>Total Cost of Ownership.</b> </p>    <img src="assets/images/blog/graph.png"  alt="graph" />   </li>   <li>    <b>Simplified Infrastructure Management</b>    <p>The major benefits businesses leverage is from the cloud infrastructure. Microsoft Azure has the best Infrastructure-as-a-service (IaaS) enabling companies to outsource cloud computing services on pay-for-what-you-use subscription. Microsoft manages everything from security upgrades to infrastructure upgrades for businesses giving them maximum flexibility on cost. </p>   </li>   <li>    <b>Disaster Recovery</b>    <p>We live in an unimaginably unpredictable world where disasters occur at any time and once businesses are hit, recovery from the loss comes with a hefty price. Businesses are migrating to Azure because they just don’t want to be another example among companies that suffered loss without cloud computing. Azure Site Recovery (ASR) provides the best DRaaS (Disaster-Recovery-as-as-Service) to help you sustain major disasters without losing business continuity. </p>   </li>   <li>    <b>Security</b>     <p>Due to the rise of sophisticated cybercrimes, data-centre security is at risk. Without cloud computing, organizations regularly fear employee/customer data leaks and hence invest considerable time and money on securing the data. Organizations that have turned to Azure cloud computing have realized it is the most advanced and protected cloud service.</p>   </li>   <li>    <b>Azure is Fast and Agile</b>    <p>Unlike other cloud providers like IBM Cloud or Google Cloud, developing, testing, deploying and maintaining business-critical software and applications on Azure is faster than you can imagine. Businesses are exploring new ideas & new technologies in Azure.</p>   </li>   <li>    <b>Fully Integrated Development</b>    <p>Azure is a fully integrated development platform where enterprises are integrating everything from the Internet of Things (IoT) to Excel for scalability and carrying out busy critical processes. With Azure, organizations reduce the risk of integration failure and experience great continuity. Its fully integrated delivery pipeline enables companies to increase efficiency in case of product upgrades & other changes creating a convincing business case.</p>   </li>   <li>    <b>Hybrid Model</b>    <p>Maybe you’re wondering if you should entirely migrate the business to the cloud or maybe you still want to have sensitive, business-critical application/data on-premise. In this case, you can stay on-premise and still be able to benefit from Microsoft Azure using a Hybrid Cloud Model. The best decision would be to stay on-premise and at the same time migrate lesser sensitive data on the cloud. </p>    <p>Migrating to Azure means to achieve higher business agility and not having to worry about managing your IT infrastructure.</p>   </li>  </ul>',

It is about learning how these technologies can be applied to the existing business models so as to yield better results.

No matter what the industry vertical, digital transformation seems to be on the agenda of most organizations. As per Gartner, <i>“Through 2024, businesses will be forced to push their plans for digital business transformation by at least five years to survive in a post-Covid world that “involves permanently higher adoption of remote work and digital touchpoints.”</i>  </p>     <p>  <b>How to Get Started</b><br>      The way I look at it, going digital is a two-fold process. The first is to have the right set of tools, technologies, and expertise that enable organizations to take that step forward into the future. However, at the same time, the digital first mindset and fixing it into the employee culture are also important. Since these are emerging technologies which come with some level of risk factors associated with them, there are several industry-standard best practices that have been created for ensuring that the risk is mitigated and a strong return on investment (ROI) is achieved when embarking on such initiatives.  </p>     <p>  <b>Our Experience at Godrej Infotech</b><br>          The tremendous potential in revolutionizing today's industry of technologies such as AI, IoT, ML, and RPA is almost unbelievable. We see that clients are looking for end-to-end solutions that can be executed in a phased manner. There are several proven use-cases and success stories that have taken place in the last 3-4 years which can now be leveraged by other organizations in a more efficient manner. Some of the inspiring examples that can be used as a reference are:  <ul>  <li>IoT techniques used on the shop floor for predictive maintenance of devices has helped in minimizing machine breakdown & unplanned outages by as much as 85% </li>  <li>AI-powered chatbots that answer simple customer inquiries serve as a welcoming presence on your website, reducing the time customers must wait to reach an agent.</li>  <li>RPA solution to automate rule-based, error-prone, manual processes have resulted in 100% accuracy and savings of as much as 2 FTE (full-time equivalent)</li>  <li>Quality inspection using machine learning techniques has resulted in defect detection within less than 30 seconds. </li>  </ul>          <p>To conclude, we can surely say that digital technologies are here to stay and dictate the future. However, before embarking on any initiative, organizations must do their due diligence by conducting a detailed cost-benefit analysis along with consultation from industry experts who can compare against standard benchmarks and best practices.   </p>    ",

      "<p>  <b>Modernization of Application Systems in Manufacturing Industry</b><br>  The Manufacturing Industry is in midst of transformation with some organizations accelerating to Industry 4.0+ platforms while other organizations struggle with infrastructure which has been built for the past. The current pandemic situation has further exacerbated the situation with hackers looking at vulnerabilities for exploitation in the Industry Infrastructure.  </p>     <p>W. Edwards Deming, a well-known proponent of statistical quality control says, “A bad system will beat a good person every time.” Hence the need for continued digitalization as many manufacturing organizations are now waking up to changing their protocols, policies, and ways of working to bring in culture, technologies and methodologies that can ensure business continuity for the next generation.   </p>     <p>A survey conducted by IndustryWeek in March 2021, indicates that 88% of Manufacturers are optimistic about 2021 as compared to the dismal 33.9% optimism low in the second quarter of 2020.</p>    <p>Here are some industry standard best practices and guidelines that can be used effectively to ensure a positive turnaround for organizations that have been hit by the pandemic. </p>     <p>Firstly, it’s critical in these situations, to ensure that the Organization’s Infrastructure is robust & can not only withstand the external threats but is also tuned to deliver the maximum value for the organization in an efficient manner. Various advances in technology can be explored based on the specific requirements for the organization. The broad roadmap that the Organizations can adopt can be briefly summarized as below:  <ul>  <li>Prioritize applications by business criticality & identify mission critical infrastructure </li>  <li>Identify the technical debt & compute the remediation cost</li>  <li>Consider the security threat for mission critical infrastructure</li>  <li>Identify various options like cloud migration & removal of technical debt based on organizational risk appetite & budget  </li>  <li>Consider Capex vs Opex models</li>  <li>Create implementation roadmap based on finalized plan</li>  <li>Measure effectiveness post Implementation</li>  </ul>  <br>          <p>Organizations committed to uplifting the perception of the manufacturing industry and taking it forward to through the combination of new technologies and people centric policies will surely see light at the end of the tunnel. At Godrej Infotech, we have worked over the last year with our parent company, Godrej & Boyce Manufacturing Ltd. to bring in many positive changes through the application of Agile Methodologies and Digital Transformation techniques. Having said that, this is just the beginning since the scope for change in traditional manufacturing organizations is phenomenal and needs to be approached in a step-by-step manner for achieving the desired results, on-time and with excellent quality.    </p>    ",

    bm_desc:
      '<p> <img src="../assets/images/blog/kapilBlog-diagram.jpg" alt="Digital Transformation"/> </p>  <p> <b>Objective</b><br> Digital improvement has become core of business strategy for every company irrespective of size, demography, and nature of business as everyone seeks to become category winner in their own categories by being more efficient &amp; effective than yesterday and technology certainly has helped many to achieve this objective. It also subconsciously creates space for organization to be a cost leader in comparison to peers and in some cases differentiator as well. </p>  <p>Companies successfully managing to upgrade themselves stand to gain from improved efficiency, cost reductions, and value extraction from core activities. Those who have not embarked on this journey yet have already started preparing roadmaps, consulting vendors, and gathering up resources to move into this direction keeping in mind the demand from the industry and from their customers.  </p>  <p>The rush to catch up influences top management or during the pace of transformation, there is good chance of leadership to get lost in the web of new ideas and initiatives.</p>  <p>Hence it is very important to layout a method to define the start and measure the route progress. </p>  <p> Approach can be broken into multiple elements may be as per running concerns of organization or internal approach towards such initiatives in history, but the primary &amp; generic ones could be:  <ul> <li>Define where you wish to be i.e. "Objective" business goals to meet.</li>  <li>Flexible / Adaptive Execution so that measures can be accommodated during the probable dynamic journey</li>  </ul></p>  <p>With the definition of approach definition of “measure” (during the course of) also become imperative i.e. you need to constantly evaluate your investment of time &amp; money, to know if it is really reaping the benefits or running in direction you had expected?</p>  <p>Here are some best practices (examples) that can be used to achieve the right balance between effectiveness and efficiency for increasing organization growth.  <ul> <li>Level I - Digital metrics need to influence business making and should give a direct indication on business impact. For example, if an automated system goes down for an hour, the metrics should indicate the impact on inventory or revenue as well, rather than, just the information that the system faced an outage for an hour.</li>  <li>Level II - Mature organization to level of using leading indicators rather than lagging indicators E.g. for serving purpose of avoiding of Level I altogether if possible, hence placing organization in position of strength (more informed) than earlier.</li>  </ul></p>  <p> So, for an organization before they approach working towards Level II which may or may not be their ultimate destination, they have success of Level I to be treated as tollgate. Bottomline is like any other IT initiative, the definition of approach and success criteria is to be laid out much in advance &amp; also to be monitored throughout the journey - parallel to benefits around business &amp; with very objective manner. </p>',

    bm_name: "Managed Services: The Promised Land?",
    bm_desc:
      "<p>Reaching the Promised land is no mean feat. Not all can endure the journey but those who do, are surely the chosen ones. With this biblical analogy let’s try to decode Managed Services.</p>    <p>Managed Services, better known as Dedicated Support Services, is a system existing since ages. Only recently it has become one of the latest buzz words in the IT Industry. It involves true dedication in letter and spirit by the Service Provider. Let’s delve deeper into the key drivers that make this world of IT impactful and understand how this model functions. </p>    <p>      <b>Continuity</b><br>      Most important aspect is the ability to keep on running the uninterrupted services even under volatile market conditions stirred by uncertainties due to attritions and the pandemic. This is a gigantic feat that is achieved through a complex web of Knowledge Transfer between existing and proposed resources and maintaining a steady backup pool who are ready to jump in when required. Role-rotation is also practiced so that team members are not restricted to one role only and there is learning, skill development and mutual dependability amongst the team.   </p>    <p>      <b>Cost Effectiveness</b><br>      Since most part of the support is managed from offshore, this is a cost-effective model. The Client has the luxury of keeping a lean team onshore who will be the key point of contact with the users and the support team. The Client also must deal with lesser concerns on attrition as their team is already lean. The same support team also when required performs roll-out or implementations so the concept of right resource at right time is utilized.   </p>    <p>      <b>Standardization</b><br>      Perhaps the best aspect of this model is that it is not resource dependent, but it is process dependent. The protocol set by the Client for processes is followed rigorously.    </p>    <p>      <b>Value Addition</b><br>      The Support team analyses the recurring issues of the Client and thereby identifies areas of improvements that are singled out. These are then mapped with a proposed solution and offered to the Client to enable reduction in repetition of such errors. This is a win-win situation for both parties who can focus less on resolution of errors and more on improvement of processes.   </p>    <p>      <b>Feedback</b><br>      Client satisfaction is a major goal and hence regular feedback is an integral part of this system. Feedback is a two-way process. The Client is requested feedback on every Incident resolved as well as a general quarterly feedback. This enables the team to identify improvement areas and work upon them. The Client also receives feedback from the team regarding areas of improvisation so that processes can be further bettered.   </p>    <p>      In today’s fast-paced world, Managed Services is a multi-beneficial offering that can step-up the performance of the Client through faster resolutions and quicker business continuity. The Promised Land is a realizable actuality for those who aspire to venture and trust the process.     </p>",

    bm_desc:
      "<p>Before we start on how to build privacy program, it is important to understand the concept of privacy and why it matters. </p>  <p>      <b>What Is Privacy?</b><br>      The concept of privacy varies widely among (and sometimes within) countries, cultures, and jurisdictions. Secondly it also depends on who you ask. Broadly speaking, privacy is the right to be let alone, or freedom from interference or intrusion. Information privacy is the right to have some control over how your personal information is collected and used.   </p>    <p>At the end of the day, privacy is about the accountability of organizations to data subjects, as well as the transparency to an organization’s practice around personal information.</p>    <p>      <b>Need for Privacy Protection / Why Does it Matter? </b><br>      The information revolution has transformed businesses, governments, and people in a big way. Virtually all business and government operations are now digital, resulting in everyone’s personal details being stored in information systems.  </p>    <p>Two issues have arisen out of this transformation: </p>    <ul>      <li>The challenge to safeguard personal information from criminal organizations, and </li>      <li>The challenge to ensure that personal information is used only for clearly stated purposes </li>  </ul>    <p></p>    <p>Numerous security and privacy laws, regulations , and standards have been enacted and created, imposing a patchwork of new requirements on organizations and governments to enact specific practices to protect and control the use of our personal information such as </p>    <ul>      <li>ISO/IEC 27701</li>      <li>GDPR</li>      <li>HIPAA</li>      <li>NIST Privacy Framework</li>      <li>NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF)</li>      <li>ISO/IEC 27001</li>      <li>NIST SP 800-53</li>      <li>NIST SP 800-122</li>      <li>Center for Internet Security Critical Security Controls (CIS CSC)</li>      <li>Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS)</li>  </ul>    <p></p>    <p>      <b>Approach to Building an Effective Privacy Program </b><br>      High level steps involved in building effective and successful privacy programs are:  </p>    <p>      <b>Step 1 – List Down your Obligations </b><br>      This is the very first step in the journey to identify and list down  </p>    <ul>      <li>Local and international laws that apply to your organization and how they affect the data that you process </li>      <li>Contracts you have that may include requirements for data privacy and security</li>  </ul>    <p></p>    <p>      <b>Step 2 – Build Inventory of Personal information </b><br>      Next is to successfully create an inventory of all you have. Personal identifiable information, or PII, exists everywhere, and while all of it is important, some PII data is more sensitive than others. This information is usually of the following types:  </p>    <ul>      <li>Information such as first name, last name, address, phone number, fax number, email, website address and birthday</li>      <li>Government issued personal data such as passports, driver's license etc.</li>      <li>Personal sensitive information is data about age, race, ethnicity, religion, union membership, biometrics, sexual orientation, and medical conditions</li>  </ul>    <p></p>    <p>      <b>Step 3 – Classifying the Data </b><br>      Identify all sources of data and data classification, and data flows for both customers and employee data records existing in repositories such as:  </p>    <ul>      <li>Databases, emails, documents, spreadsheets, cloud drives, removable drives, and mobile devices. </li>      <li>Application logs, backups third-party systems and cloud storage such as AWS, S3, and Azure Blobs</li>      <li>Unstructured data such as images, videos, and call recordings</li>      <li>Metadata such as websites, usage analytics, user clicks, and links visited</li>  </ul>    <p></p>    <p>Additionally, you also need to ask data owners from different departments to identify and classify the processing of personal information </p>    <ul>      <li>What is the purpose of processing personal data?</li>      <li>Is the data being transferred to a third party?</li>      <li>Duration of storage along with quantity of data that is being stored</li>      <li>Will data be transferred to or from other countries, and if so, how will this be accomplished?</li>  </ul>    <p></p>    <p>      <b>Step 4 – Understand & Manage Risk to Personal Information </b><br>      Conduct Privacy Impact Assessment (PIA), which is a tool for identifying and assessing privacy risks throughout the development life cycle of a program or system. It is an ongoing activity as new regulations in the data landscape continue to evolve. At a minimum, risk assessment should be performed every year.   </p>    <p>Good resources on conducting assessments & protecting Personal data:</p>    <ul>      <li>CNIL PIA Knowledge bases.</li>      <li>Secure Data Lifecycle method by Cassio Goldschmidt</li>      <li>KPMG Data Lifecycle from publication: Enhancing Privacy Provision in Cloud Computing</li>  </ul>  <p></p>  <p>      <b>Step 5 – Setting up Privacy Policies and Communication </b><br>      Your organization's privacy policies and notice are central to your privacy program.   </p>    <ul>      <li>Privacy policies are internal documents that describe internal procedures. </li>      <li>Privacy notice are external documents that take the form of disclosures and statements to explain how your organization collects, use, retain, and disclose personal information.</li>  </ul>    <p>Both internal and external privacy policies, or notices, are important documents, and when an organization violates the promise bounding them, an organization might be subject to enforcement action for false practice.</p>  <p>      <b>Step 6 – Setting up Communication Channels</b><br>      Your organization's privacy policies and notice are central to your privacy program.   </p>    <p><i>“I've come to the conclusion that if you give a data point to a company, they will eventually sell it, leak it, lose it or get hacked and relieved of it. There really don’t seem to be any exceptions….” Brian Krebs</i></p>    <p>Organizations should have a process in place to respond and mitigate the impact of incidents if any. </p>    <p>A quick response, even if not perfect, is better than a delayed response, so when breach happens then let's get into who needs to be notified internally. </p>    <ul>      <li>          From business, most immediately, your executives, leadership needs to be informed about any relevant incident as soon as possible as they will serve as spokesperson during a data breach.       </li>      <li>From a technical side, key representatives of your information security, information technology, product and engineering department should also join the response team.</li>      <li>It is important to notify your users. </li>      <li>Lastly a timely public notice avoids rumours and speculations by customers and the media, positioning your company as the source of truth.</li>  </ul>  <p></p>  <p>Your company's odds of effectively responding to an incident will significantly increase if you prepare ahead of time. So, understand the breach laws that apply to your organization and create a plan with procedures, message templates and contact information for your internal staff and third-party organizations.</p>    <p><b>Step 7 – Training and Awareness</b><br>      The primary objective of privacy awareness programs is the keen awareness, on the part of all personnel, of the proper handling of personal information, the reality of the different types of attacks that they may be subject to, and what they are expected to do in various situations.  </p>    <p>Furthermore, users must understand and comply with an organization’s acceptable use policy, privacy policy, security policy, code of ethics or code of conduct, and other applicable policies.</p>    <p>Good resource on what should be included in your privacy awareness training refer to “What Should Privacy Awareness Training Include?” By Daniel Solove.</p>    <p><b>Step 8: Measure Performance of your Privacy Program</b><br>      Set KPIs to ensure your program progresses as planned. Also conducting audits (internal / external) may provide insights on how effectively your privacy operations are functioning.  </p>    <p>Some KPIs to measure will be:</p>    <ul>      <li>The percentage of employees trained effectively </li>      <li>The number of breaches and near misses </li>      <li>The number of transfers or impact assessments completed </li>      <li>The average time it takes to investigate and report breaches</li>      <li>The average time to respond to individual access requests</li>  </ul>    <p>Once the analysis ends, results should turn into reports for upper management to review. This will allow improvements and changes to take place as needed. </p>    <p><b>Privacy is Continuous Improvement Cycle</b><br>      An organization should consider all of its privacy and security programs operations as “works in progress”, meaning that management and staff recognize that their processes and controls have not achieved a level of perfection, and likely never will. A spirit of continuous improvement should encourage a culture of “we can and should do better.”  </p>",

Having said that, this is just the beginning since the scope for change in traditional manufacturing organizations is phenomenal and needs to be approached in a step-by-step manner for achieving the desired results, on-time and with excellent quality.    </p>  <p>As a Solution Architect at Godrej Infotech, I have actively been working with multiple organizations helping them to upgrade their AX 2012 systems to D365. In my experience, it has been a productive exercise that has brought in many benefits to customer organizations such as -    <ul>  <li>Reduced hardware / software maintenance costs due to adoption of cloud</li>  <li>Easy scalability based on requirements </li>  <li>Any-time, any-place, any-device access</li>  <li>Increase in employee productivity</li>  <li>Enables organizations for new technology adoption roadmap</li>    </ul>  </p>    <p>For example, we did upgrade projects for several of our customers and all of them have opted for Cloud solution in place of on-premises AX 2012 ERP application.   <ul>      <li><strong>Project 01:</strong> Global NGO for environmental sustainability projects chose to do D365 Finance &amp; Supply Chain ERP upgrade and opted for cloud implementation, resulting in enormous flexibility in management reporting based on real-time information. </li>      <li><strong>Project 02:</strong> Manufacturing company having 05 different Electrical product manufacturing scenarios has chosen to take fresh implementation approach instead of going for code and data upgrade. The integrated CRM &amp; ERP system has significantly reduced the communication gaps and increased efficiency.</li>  </ul>  </p>    <p>Based on our experience, there are 03 approaches for upgrade projects that needs to be thoroughly evaluated    <ul>      <li>Code upgrade + Data Upgrade</li>      <li>Only Code upgrade (Use Power BI for old historical data reporting)</li>      <li>Fresh Implementation</li>  </ul>  </p>    <p>Best approach needs to be decided based on client needs and specific business scenarios, however following key factors needs to be considered for deciding right approach for upgrade projects –   <ul>      <li>Customization of functionality and reports in AX – Previous layering of code is no more supported, hence we built customization &amp; reports using extensions</li>      <li>Use of deprecated features, these features cannot be upgraded</li>      <li>Interface patterns and tools – Application Integration Framework (AIF) in AX 2012 is not supported, hence fresh design and development approach is needed for integrations using OData, Rest APIs, and Power Platform</li>      <li>Cloud vs on-premises solution – impact of hardware, software, and licensing </li>      <li>Honest disclosure about need to review existing implementation/learnings</li>      <li>Not a “push button” upgrade</li>  <li>Discussion about how to "do it better this time…", lessons learned</li>  </ul>  </p>  <p>I would strongly recommend this approach to organizations looking for an upgrade, especially to those organizations that are already on the Microsoft solution stack. We have several Microsoft certified professionals that are well versed with our rapid implementation methodology that is secure, reliable, and fit for various industries such as manufacturing, retail, logistics, projects &amp; service.

    bm_desc:
      '<p>The weekly meeting had stretched beyond usual time and tempers like the hot summer outside the room were simmering. The cheese and chutney sandwiches meant for the working lunch placed on the long wooden side table nearby were getting cold. The dignified looking grey-haired gentleman seated at the head of the table got up. He casually walked towards the table, picked up the tray of sandwiches and began offering it to those sitting around the conference table. I blinked in confusion, he was the President, an alumnus of the country’s top MBA institutes. Those around the table had gone quiet, one single action had conveyed the message that you lead by example, don’t wait for someone else to do it. My admiration grew leaps and bounds, I had learned my first lesson of Servant Leadership.</p>    <p>Over the years I learnt some important characteristics about Servant Leaders. These are charismatic leaders who build great teams by their genuine desire to serve employees. In a nutshell these leaders lead by example, humility being the foundation and trust the glue which binds their teams. They practice active listening, and act upon feedback. They make sure that their message is clear and reaches across all teams. Servant Leaders encourage collaboration because they trust, they can empower their teams and delegate effectively. They involve their teams in decision making and invest in their growth and learning.</p>    <p>They genuinely care for their team members!</p>    <p>According to Larry C. Spears, former president of the Robert K. Greenleaf Center for Servant Leadership, these are the 10 most important characteristics of Servant Leaders:   </p>    <p>   <ul>    <li>Listening</li>    <li>Empathy</li>    <li>Healing</li>    <li>Awareness</li>    <li>Persuasion</li>    <li>Conceptualization</li>    <li>Foresight</li>    <li>Stewardship</li>    <li>Commitment to the growth of people</li>    <li>Building community</li>         </ul>    </p>    <p>As per Robert K. Greenleaf, as a servant leader, you\'re a "servant first" – you focus on the needs of others, especially team members, before you consider your own. More than being a leadership style, Servant Leadership is a way of behaving that you adopt over the longer term. Servant Leadership is not about how the team feels but about what the team needs, and hence it doesn’t mean avoiding making unpopular decisions or giving team members negative feedback when needed.</p>    <p>As the pandemic has ebbed and life goes on, the stress and challenges we faced have transformed us. We learnt to be flexible, we learned what it is to be empathetic. We now know that we can do things faster than we thought was previously possible. We learnt to survive and adapt to changed ways. These changes call for leaders who will fill the vacuum in the aftermath of the pandemic. To end with a quote from one of the finest Servant Leaders of our times who never needed a battle cry to be heard but left behind a legacy which continues to be a source of inspiration to leaders across the world.</p>    <p><strong><i>“People are unrealistic, illogical, and self-centred. Love them anyway.” Mother Teresa</i></strong></p>    <p>   The journey of a Servant Leader is tough and at times you may give in to your pride, get swayed by popular sentiments in place of fair judgement, & you may even face rejection for giving honest feedback.</p>      <p>However, take a moment to ponder, the choice you make today will touch lives, like mine on that hot summer afternoon ….</p>',

      "<p>Every organization today is looking for innovative ways to optimize business processes, reduce costs & improve user experience. Given that work from home has been a dominant factor for most corporates since last 2 years, it has become imperative for organizations to change with times and let go of paper-based ways of filling forms and seeking approvals. </p>    <p>Furthermore, next-gen employees have been born in a digital world where automation, rapid implementation and agile ways of working are considered as normal.  Growing demand for modernization of business processes along with short supply of professional developers has given rise to concept of low-code/ no-code programming and citizen developers. </p>    <p>Software companies such as Microsoft have been quick to identify these changing trends &amp; have introduced Microsoft Power Platform as a solution to above challenges. Power Platform consists of following 4 individual components - </p>     <ul>    <li>Power Apps     <ul>      <li>Has a simple drag & drop based user interface for building custom Apps      </li>     </ul>    </li>    <li>Power Automate     <ul>      <li>Used for creating enterprise-grade process automation workflows      </li>     </ul>    </li>    <li>Power BI      <ul>      <li>Allows for creation of visually enhanced & easy to understand dashboards & reports       </li>     </ul>    </li>    <li>Power Virtual Agents     <ul>      <li>GUI based software for chatbot creation       </li>     </ul>    </li>         </ul>    <br></br>  <p>With these tools, it becomes easy to design, develop & deploy fully functional & user-friendly apps with reduced development effort, thus resulting in saving of time & cost. Skilled resources with extensive domain & technology expertise can thus be utilized for other important activities leading to optimum load balancing & resource utilization within organizations. </p>    <p>At Godrej Infotech, we follow a hands-on approach and have done quite a few projects using Power Platform. Here are a few success stories of how we have applied this low-code Power Apps approach to increase productivity for our customer organizations.    <ul>   <li>Communications App for Leading Organization in Construction Industry<br/>   We have developed a smart decision-making app that has a summarized UI for quick reference checking & easily integrates with multiple notification channels like e-mails & SMS. It helps organization take decisions based on data readily available at their fingertips resulting in transparent & efficient approval processes.</li>     <li>Project Lifecycle Management App for Global Provider of Engineered Solutions <br/>   This easy-to-use app tracks projects from creation to closure. It integrates with Kissflow for workflow management and allows users to access & process data in new ways resulting in improved productivity.  </li>  </ul>    </p>  <p>Even though Power Platform is easy to use by citizen developers, it must not be misunderstood that it cannot be deployed at enterprise scale. In fact, it has been recognized by Forrester as a Leader in Low Code Development Tools and offers 99.9 uptime guarantee along with built-in security roles and permissions. To conclude, this is a highly recommended software that can help organizations move forward on their digital transformation journey. </p>",

      '<p>The IT Industry has seen various phases of evolution of application development & maintenance. In the earlier days, there used to be monolithic applications that used to be deployed on physical servers. Waterfall methodology was used wherein analysis, design, development & deployment phases were done in a sequential manner one after the other, and each succeeding phase could not be started before the preceding phase was completed.</p>    <p>Then came the era of Service Oriented Architecture (SOA), where applications were deployed on Virtual Machines (VMs) & Agile methodology was used for development. A huge improvement from the earlier approach, this resulted in rapid application development & faster time-to-market, making it easier for both standard product & custom-software technology organizations.</p>    <p>As we continue to innovate towards digital transformation, we have now reached the trend of ‘Microservice’ Architecture, with applications deployed on the Cloud & DevOps as the development methodology & approach. This trend is also known as Application Modernization with transformations in architecture, infrastructure and delivery all happening at the same time. </p>    <p>Types of App Modernization</p>     <ul>    <li>Lift & shift </li>   </ul>        <p style="padding-left: 2rem">One of the simplest strategies for modernization, in this approach, applications & data are migrated to cloud without any changes in code. </p>      <ul>     <li>Refactoring </li>    </ul>        <p style="padding-left: 2rem">In this approach, underlying code is re-written so that it is better fit for deploying on the cloud. </p>                     <ul>     <li>Trends in Cloud Deployment</li>      </ul>      <p style="padding-left: 2rem">Organizations can choose from multi-cloud (use of more than one public cloud), hybrid-cloud (combination of public, private & on-premise deployments) or container-based (use of micro-services for decoupled applications) approaches for their modernization efforts.</p>          <ul>    <li>Easy Modernization for .NET Apps</li>   </ul>      <p style="padding-left: 2rem">With .NET, app modernization becomes easier because latest releases of .NET Platform come pre-built for cloud platforms such as Microsoft Azure, Amazon AWS & Google Cloud Platform.

      "<p>Microsoft has been selected as a Leader in the 2022 Gartner<sup>&#174;</sup> Magic Quadrant<sup>&#8482;</sup> for Robotic Process Automation (RPA). Here are some highlights on how organizations can use Power Automate to streamline their business processes and eliminate repetitive tasks.  </p>    <p>Power Automate is a low code development tool that can be used by business users as well as by technology teams to create desktop & cloud flows. Desktop flows can further be categorized as attended RPA or un-attended RPA, depending on the level of manual intervention required. Cloud flows can be automated flows that are based on event triggers or instant flows that run immediately after an action. Users can also automate their tasks based on scheduled flows that get activated on a pre-determined date and time. </p>    <p>What makes this simple tool so easy to use? For one, there are pre-built connectors & templates that can be used for task automation such as approvals, image detection, email management, and intelligent document processing (IDP). Another important aspect is that Power Automate is part of the Power Platform, D365, O365 ecosystem, so integration with these sources is easier. Few other highlights that have impressed users in the banking, retail, manufacturing, insurance & healthcare industries are -  </p>     <ul>    <li>AI Builder    <ul>     <li>     Organizations can create, train, and publish AI models that can perform tasks intelligently.

    bm_name: "Change Management and its role in Successful ERP Implementation",
    bm_desc:
      "   <p>ERP (Enterprise Resource Planning) implementation is a crucial step for any organization. It is a very impactful decision which affects the present and future of the company. The success of an ERP implementation does not solely depend on technical aspects. It requires careful consideration of human elements for accepting the change. Successful ERP implementation requires careful planning and well-proven methods to mitigate risk.</p>    <p>   <strong>What is Change Management?</strong><br/>   Change management is a collective term for all approaches used to prepare, support and help individuals and teams to facilitate any organizational changes. Changes may be necessary for business growth and expansion or the ongoing evolution of technology. In the context of ERP, change management promotes acceptance and buy-in from end users, leading to a smoother transition and increased system utilization. It focuses on addressing the human side of the transition, ensuring that employees are prepared, motivated, and empowered to embrace the changes brought about by the new system.    </p>    <p>  <strong>Why do you need change management?</strong><br/>   People don’t like to deviate from their operational comfort zone. To ensure a successful implementation of changes, organizations must recognize the crucial role of change management. ERP implementations can be disruptive and met with resistance from employees who are accustomed to existing processes. Change management identifies potential sources of resistance and develops strategies to mitigate them, ensuring a more seamless transition and minimizing disruption to business operations.<br/>   In case the Change Management aspects are not addressed, it can result in confusion, resistance, and ultimately failure of the ERP Implementation.  </p>  <p>   <strong>Change Management Strategies for Successful ERP Implementation</strong><br/>   It is extremely important to ensure that the senior management has prepared the organization for the implementation and is supportive of the same. The senior management needs to address any concerns/issues for the team and ensure that they provide the necessary support.    </p>   <ul>    <li>Stake Holder Management:     <ul>     <li>     Identify key stakeholders, including executives, department heads, end-users, and IT personnel. Understanding their needs, concerns, and expectations is essential for tailoring communication messages effectively. <br/>Utilize a mix of communication channels such as emails, newsletters, intranet portals, town hall meetings, and team huddles. Choose channels based on the message's urgency, target audience, and desired level of interactivity.     <br/>    </li>   </ul>   </li>   <br/>    <li>Risk Management:     <ul>     <li>     Typically, ERP projects introduce massive changes in organizations, but too often companies focus on the major scheme of things and don’t focus on the impact it has on employee’s tasks or even their job roles. So risk assessment is a crucial process for organizations to mitigate the risks associated with change. It involves looking at potential change initiatives and examining how they may affect an organization’s resources and operations. It is important to determine objectives, analyze relevant data sources, identify risks and their root causes, and create viable response plans. <br/>       <strong>Sustainability:</strong> ERP implementation may result in changes in organizational processes and culture. The changes need to weave into the organizational fabric to ensure that changes are gradually adopted and form a part of the organization’s DNA.          </li>   </ul>  </li>  <br/>  <li>Training Strategy:     <ul>     <li>     As your workplace changes and your software becomes updated and modified, subsequent training will be required for ongoing usage. Godrej Infotech uses Train-the-Trainer Approach that trains a selected group of power users or superusers who can serve as internal trainers and provide ongoing support and motivation to end-users. They should demonstrate how the new system with benefit individuals, teams and the organization. This helps build confidence, internal expertise and ensures a continuous learning process.    </li>   </ul>  </li>    </ul>    <br/>  <p><strong>Key Takeaways</strong>   <br/>  Creating a culture of change by aligning organizational values and goals with the ERP implementation promotes adoption.<br/>   Recognizing early adapters and teams for their efforts and achievements can create positive change management impact. <br/>  Additionally, it is essential to embrace a culture of continuous improvement, encouraging feedback, and incorporating lessons learned into future change initiatives.<br/>  Identify risks and have a mitigation plan to avoid implementation failures. Establishing a dedicated change management team to help  address employee concerns and provide support.<br/>  Emphasizing the benefits of the ERP system and maintaining open communication channels are crucial for successful change management. <br/>  End Note - A little pushback can be healthy for your management team as it forces them to choose their battles carefully. Change helps to manage the transformation in the human side of change, ensuring all stakeholders are engaged and adopt the changes necessary for the success of the implementation.</p>",
